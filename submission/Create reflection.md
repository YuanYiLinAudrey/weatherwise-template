# Reflection – WeatherWise Project

Working on the WeatherWise project has been a highly rewarding experience. As a postgraduate student majoring in Information Systems and Technology with no prior programming background, I initially felt overwhelmed. However, this project has helped me build confidence and gain practical skills in Python, API integration, data visualisation, and modular program design.

One major challenge I encountered was structuring the project from scratch. I had difficulty understanding how to connect different functions and manage the overall flow. To solve this, I broke the problem into smaller parts and asked ChatGPT detailed questions to guide my development process step by step. The AI-assisted explanations made abstract concepts more digestible and gave me clarity on how to proceed.

Another challenge was creating and rendering weather graphs. At first, I struggled with parsing weather data and using `matplotlib`, but through repeated trial and error—along with AI feedback—I eventually created functional and visually appealing temperature and precipitation charts.

The most valuable part of this project was learning how to use AI tools like ChatGPT not just to solve coding problems, but to assist in debugging, designing logic, and understanding documentation. I also learned how to document my development journey and store AI conversations as `.txt` logs in GitHub, which improved my awareness of reproducible coding practices.

In summary, I developed not only technical skills but also a structured, independent learning mindset. This project helped bridge the gap between theory and practical application and gave me a strong foundation for future software development work.
