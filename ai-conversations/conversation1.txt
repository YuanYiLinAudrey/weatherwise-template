Hi, Iâ€™m a postgraduate student studying Information Systems and Technology, but I have no programming background. This WeatherWise assignment looks overwhelming. What exactly is it asking me to do, and how do I start?

AI:  
No worries! Iâ€™ll walk you through it step by step.  
WeatherWise is a hands-on Python programming project that lets you apply what youâ€™ve learned across the semester. Youâ€™ll build a weather advisor app with these core features:

1. ðŸŒ¦ Fetch real-time weather data using an API (with a backup if needed)  
2. ðŸ“Š Create weather visualisations using graphs (e.g., temperature and precipitation)  
3. ðŸ§  Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) so users can ask weather-related questions  
4. ðŸ¤– Leverage AI tools like ChatGPT to improve your code, document your development process, and log interactions  
5. ðŸ—ƒ Submit everything to GitHub and upload a final ZIP to the LMS  

You donâ€™t need to code everything from scratch â€” youâ€™ll be working within a provided Jupyter Notebook structure (`starter_notebook.ipynb`) in Google Colab. The goal is to fill in the code blocks step by step.

Me:  
Whatâ€™s the first thing I should do?

AI:  
âœ… Step 1: Go to the GitHub template and click "Use this template" to create your own repo (youâ€™ve already done this).  
âœ… Step 2: Open `starter_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab from your repo.  
âœ… Step 3: Work through the notebook from top to bottom â€” the sections guide you through setup, API, visualisation, NLP, and testing.  

Youâ€™ll also need to log at least 5 meaningful AI conversations (like this one) in `.txt` format and include them in the `ai-conversations/` folder.

Just take it one section at a time. Iâ€™ll help you at each step.
